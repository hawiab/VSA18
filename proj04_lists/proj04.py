practice with lists

"""

#Part I
#Take a list, say for example this one:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

for item in a:
    if item < 30:
        print item




#Part II
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
b = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that creates and prints a list that contains only the elements
# that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
for items in b:
    for numbers in c:
        if items == numbers:
            print items
items.append[1]

#Part III
# Take a list, say for example this one:

d = ["b", "a", "f", "y", "a", "t", "_", "p", "a", "R"]
# and write a program that replaces all “a” with “*”.

for a in d:
     with *




#Part IV
#Ask the user for a string, and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
